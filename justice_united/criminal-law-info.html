        Criminal law deals with behavior that is or can be construed as an offense against the public, society, 
        or the state—even if the immediate victim is an individual. Examples are murder, assault, theft,and drunken driving.
        Civil law deals with behavior that constitutes an injury to an individual or other private party,
        such as a corporation. Examples are defamation (including libel and slander), breach of contract, negligence resulting in injury or death, and property damage.
        <br>
        Criminal law and civil law differ with respect to how cases are initiated (who may bring charges or file suit), 
        how cases are decided (by a judge or a jury), what kinds of punishment or penalty may be imposed,
        what standards of proof must be met, and what legal protections may be available to the defendant.
        <br>
        In criminal cases, for example, only the federal or a state government (the prosecution) may initiate a case;
        cases are almost always decided by a jury; punishment for serious (felony) charges often consists of imprisonment but may also include a fine paid to 
        the government; to secure conviction, the prosecution must establish the guilt of the defendant "beyond a reasonable doubt";
        and defendants are protected against conduct by police or prosecutors that violates their constitutional rights,
        including the right against unreasonable searches and seizures (Fourth Amendment) and the right against compelled self-incrimination (Fifth Amendment).

        Murder is the act of causing the death of another person without legal justification or excuse.<br>
        The U.S. federal code and most state codes distinguish between different degrees of murder, though state codes differ in how many degrees are recognized (one, two, or three) and how the degrees are defined. In general,
        however, an act of murder falls under the category of first degree if one or more of the following elements are present:<br><br>
        (1) The perpetrator intended to cause the death of the victim or someone else (malice aforethought, or mens rea),
        and the perpetrator formed a plan to cause the victim’s death or that of someone else or thought about that outcome for at least a minimum amount of time (premeditation).<br><br><br>
        (2) The perpetrator caused the death of the victim while committing or attempting to commit any of a range of serious felonies, 
        usually including burglary, robbery, rape, child abuse, arson, and kidnapping, among others.
        Some states, however, classify such “felony murders” as murder in the second degree.<br><br><br>
        (3) The victim was a police officer or other law-enforcement official; the perpetrator killed the victim in a particularly gruesome fashion,
        such as by poison or torture; the perpetrator ambushed the victim; or the perpetrator killed more than one person.<br><br><br>

        The basic requirement is an LLB degree from any South African university. Having achieved this, the next step is to apply to the High Court to be included on the

        To do this, an applicant must satisfy the court that he/she is both qualified and able to be a member of the profession.

        Absent the doctrine of common purpose, the South African common law of criminal liability recognizes four separate and distinct elements or requirements, namely:
        (i) an act (actus reus);<br>
        (ii) which is unlawful (unlawfulness);<br>
        (iii) causing the crime (causation);<br>
        and (iv) committed with the necessary intent or culpa (mens rea).<br>
        The doctrine of common purpose concerns only the element of causation.

            <h2 class="subHeading-title">Principles of criminal law</h2>
            <section class="subHeading-info">
                The traditional approach to criminal law has been that a crime is an act that is morally wrong.
                The purpose of criminal sanctions was to make the offender give retribution for harm done and expiate his moral guilt;
                punishment was to be meted out in proportion to the guilt of the accused. In modern times more rationalistic and pragmatic views have predominated.
                Writers of the Enlightenment such as Cesare Beccaria in Italy, Montesquieu and Voltaire in France, Jeremy Bentham in Britain,
                and P.J.A. von Feuerbach in Germany considered the main purpose of criminal law to be the prevention of crime.
                <br><br>
                With the development of the social sciences, there arose new concepts, such as those of the protection of the public and the reform of the offender.
                Such a purpose can be seen in the German criminal code of 1998,
                which admonished the courts that the “effects which the punishment will be expected to have on the perpetrator’s future life in society shall be considered.”
                <br><br>
                In the United States a Model Penal Code proposed by the American Law Institute in 1962 states that an objective of criminal law should be 
                “to give fair warning of the nature of the conduct declared to constitute an offense” and “to promote the correction and rehabilitation of offenders.”
                Since that time there has been renewed interest in the concept of general prevention,
                including both the deterrence of possible offenders and the stabilization and strengthening of social norms.

            <section class="subHeading-info">
                Probably the most important principle of criminal liability is captured in the dictum actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea,
                or "an act is not unlawful unless there is a guilty mind." To establish criminal liability, the State must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt,
                that the accused has committed:
                <ul>
                <li>voluntary conduct which is unlawful (actus reus); accompanied by</li>
                <li>criminal capacity; and</li>
                <li>fault (mens rea, in the form of intention or negligence).</li>

                Assault with intent to grievous bodily harm

The common-law definition of "treason," found in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=S_v_Banda&action=edit&redlink=1">S v Banda</a>,
is "any overt act committed by a person, within or without the State, who, owing allegiance to the State, having majestas," has the intention of
<ul>
<li>"unlawfully impairing, violating, threatening or endangering the existence, independence or security of the State;</li>
<li>"unlawfully overthrowing the government of the State;</li>
<li>"unlawfully changing the constitutional structure of the State; or</li>
<li>"unlawfully coercing by violence the government of the State into any action or into refraining from any action."</li>
<li>This definition would appear to be the one most frequently relied upon in South African courts</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="subHeading-title" style="font-size: 16px; text-decoration: underline;">Damage of property</h2>
<h3 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px">Arson:</h3>
A person commits arson if he unlawfully and intentionally sets fire to:
<ul>
<li>immovable property belonging to another; or</li>
<li>his own immovable insured property, to claim the value of property from an insurer.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3 class="subHeading-title" style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px">Elements</h3>
The elements of the crime are the following: 
<br>
(a) setting fire to (b) immovable property (c) unlawfully and (d) intentionally.
<br>

<h3 class="subHeading-title" style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px; text-decoration: underline;">Requirements</h3>
Arson is only a particular form of the crime of malicious injury to property. 
The crime can be committed only in respect of immovable property:
that is, "buildings and other immovable property."
If movable property is set alight, the crime of malicious injury to property may be committed, 
provided that the other requirements are met. 
The crime is completed only at the moment that the property has been set alight.
If the arsonist is caught at a stage before the property has been set alight, he is guilty of attempted arson only,
provided that his conduct has, according to the general rules governing liability for attempt, proceeded beyond mere acts of preparation.
<br>
As in malicious injury to property, 
one cannot in principle commit arson in respect of one's own property. 
The courts, however, including the appellate division, in R v Mavros,
have held that a person commits arson if he sets fire to his own property to claim its value from the insurer.
In the estimation of Snyman, "It would have been better to punish this type of conduct as fraud instead of arson, but the courts will in
all probability not depart from the appeal court's view."<br>

Intention, and more particularly the intention to damage property by setting fire to it, 
thereby causing patrimonial harm to somebody, is also required. 
Dolus eventualis in this regard is sufficient.
