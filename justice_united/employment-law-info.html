        The employee is under no obligation to work more than 45 hours per week. 
        All overtime is voluntary and may only be worked by agreement between employer and employee.
        Maximum permissible overtime is 3 hours on anyone day or 10 hours in any 1 week.

                    I have told my employer I want to take my leave in my period of notice but he refuses.</p>

        Section 20 (5) (b) of the BCEA states clearly that “the employer may not require or permit an employee to take annual leave during any period of notice of termination of employment.”<br>

        This means that, in terms of the act, an employee is prohibited from taking leave during his period of notice on resignation, and the employer is prohibited from forcing the employee to take leave during any period of notice.<br>
        
        We have an employee who has given us four weeks notice, but the employment contract states one calendar month – what can we do? The conditions of the employment contract are lawful, provided that the period of notice applies to the employer – namely that if the employee should be retrenched or dismissed with notice, then the employer is obliged to also give the employee one calendar months notice.<br>
        
        If the condition applies to both parties, then the employer can force the employee to comply with the condition. Should the employee refuse and simply walked out, the only thing the employer can do is sue the employee for damages in terms of breach of contract.

        Unfortunately you are not permitted to do that. Section 40 of the BCEA makes it clear what payments must be made to an employee upon termination of employment, and this includes outstanding leave pay. The only way this can be overcome is if it is inserted into the employment contract as a condition of employment that should the employee contravene the provisions regarding the period of notice required, then the employer would be entitled to withhold salary or leave pay in lieu of notice.

However, you would not be entitled to now rush out and amend all your existing employment contracts. If you wish to do that, it can only be done by consultation with your existing employees.

       <section class="answer">
        Unfortunately not. It is now for too late, and the horse has escaped. 
        I might add that the employee would indeed be very stupid to sign such an agreement after he has resigned. 
        You cannot force any employee to sign anything that he does not wish to sign.

            <section class="subHeading-info">
                <h2>Parties</h2>
                <h3>Identification</h3>
                The first question to be asked, when seeking to resolve any labour law problem, is whether the parties are indeed "employees" and "employers" wi
                thin the meaning of the applicable statute or the common law.<br>

                <h2>Common law</h2>
                The first source to be examined, when seeking to determine whether parties to a work relationship are employers and employees, is the contract into which they have entered.<br>
                A contract of employment comes into existence when the parties conclude an agreement that conforms to the requirements of the locatio conductio operarum. The contract of employment is traditionally defined as "a contract between two persons, the master (employer) and the servant (employee), for the letting and hiring of the latter's services for reward, the master being able to supervise and control the servant's work."<br>
                The true nature of the contract, therefore, is determined from the relationship between the parties, not merely the label the parties have given their contract.<br>

                <h2>Statutes</h2>
                Statutory definitions do not resolve the problem. "Employee" is defined
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        in section 213 of the Labour Relations Act 1995 as
                        <ul>
                            <li>"any person excluding an independent contractor, who works for another person or for the State, and who receives, or is entitled to receive, any remuneration; and</li>
                            <li>"any other person who in any manner assists in carrying on or conducting the business of an employer;"</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        in section 1 of the Basic Conditions of Employment Act in exactly the same words; but
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        in section 1 of the EEA as "any person other than an independent contractor who
                        <ul>
                            <li>"works for another person or for the State and who receives, or is entitled to receive, any remuneration; and</li>
                            <li>"in any manner assists in carrying on or conducting the business of an employer."</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Courts</h2>
                Labour legislation does not define "contract of service" or the concept of "work" at all.<br>
                This means that it is necessary to look outside the legislation to determine the meaning of these terms, in order to distinguish between an employee and an independent contractor.<br>
                The courts have formulated a number of tests for drawing the distinction.<br>

                <h2>Control test</h2>
                The control test focuses on the element of "control" exercised by the employer over the employee.<br>
                The power to control has traditionally been regarded as the hallmark of the employment contract. 
                With the advent of highly skilled employees who are given free rein in performing their duties, the courts no longer insist on de facto control, 
                as once they did, but recognise that a right to control is sufficient.<br>

               <h2>Organisation test</h2>
               The organisation test was developed in French law and adopted by South African law in R v AMCA Services and Another.
               It is based upon the assumption that whether or not one is an employee does not rest on submission to orders; it depends on whether the person is part and parcel of the organisation.<br>

               <h2>Differences between employees and independent contractors</h2>
               In SA Broadcasting Corporation v McKenzie,
               the Labour Appeal Court summarised the main differences between the contract of employment proper 
               and what is called the "contract of work" (locatio conductio operis):
               <ul>
                <li>In the first, the object is the rendering of personal services between employer and employee; in the second, 
                    the object is the production of a certain specified service or the production of a certain specified result.</li>
                <li>
                    The employee renders the service at the behest of the employer;
                    the independent contractor is not obliged to perform his work personally, unless otherwise agreed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The employer may decide whether it wishes to have employee render service;
                    the independent contractor is bound to perform specified work or produce a specified result within a specified or reasonable time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The employee is obliged to obey lawful, reasonable instructions regarding work to be done, and the manner in which it is to be done;
                    the independent contractor is not obliged to obey instructions regarding the manner in which a task is to be performed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A contract of employment proper is terminated by the death of the employee;
                    the contract of work is not terminated by the death of the contractor.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A contract of employment terminates on completion of the agreed period;
                    the contract of work terminates on completion of the specified work, or on production of the specified result.
                </li>
