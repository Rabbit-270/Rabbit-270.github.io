    <h1 id="title">South African Immigration Laws</h1>
    <h2 id="sub-title">The Immigration Act (no 13 of 2002) deals with immigrants and migrants and 
        uses a licence fee to manage the process of allowing foreigners to work and live in South Africa.

        Whether you are an asylum or refugee seeker, or someone who wants to apply for citizenship or permanent/temporary residency,
        an experienced Immigration Attorney can give you the necessary legal advice and handle the application on your behalf.

        This is a permit that allows one to stay permanently in South Africa, while remaining a citizen of another country. <br>
        According to the Immigration Amendment Act such a permit can be issued on condition the holder is neither prohibited nor undesirable.<br><br>
        <h2 style="font-weight: bolder; font-size: 17px;">There are 4 ways of obtaining a permanent residence permit, if the person:</h2>
        <ul>
           <li>Has been the holder of a work permit for at least 5 years, and has received an offer of employment.</li>
<li>Has been the spouse of a citizen or permanent resident for 5 years.</li>
<li>Is a child of a permanent resident under 21 years old.</li>
<li>Is a child of a South African citizen.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        The applicant must be of good character, and a ‘desirable inhabitant’ in South Africa, and not likely to take a job for 
        which there are enough South Africans available.
         The committee will pay special consideration to applicants who are aged or destitute or disabled dependant of a permanent resident,
        as well as the husband or wife of a South African citizen of a permanent resident. The Department of Home affairs may not refuse to 
        issue work permits to foreign-born spouses of South African citizens without a very good reason. 
        If the permit is refused the applicant may ask the Central Board to review the provincial committee’s decision but it does not have 
        to do so.You will have to contact an attorney urgently to see if there can be any court challenge to the decision.

    The Constitutional Court has said South Africans have a right to live in the country they were born in with the partner of their choice.
    This means the government cannot refuse to give immigration permits to foreign-born spouses (husbands and wives) of South African 
    citizens.

            <section class="subHeading-info">
                A Refugee is a person from another country who has fled to South Africa to escape war or persecution, and who has been granted refugee status under The Refugee Act No 130 of 1998.<br>

An asylum seeker is a person from another country who has fled to South Africa to escape war or extreme violence, and is formally seeking refugee status but has not yet been granted it.<br>

An undocumented foreign national is a person from another country who has entered South Africa and is in the country illegally, because they have not engaged any formal processes to legalise their residence-or they have not engaged successfully. This person is undocumented in South Africa.<br>

The Refugee Act No 130 of 1998 (which applies to refugees living in South Africa) says that South Africa cannot refuse to allow a foreigner into the country or force them to return to their own country if in their own country:<br>
<ul>
<li>They would be persecuted because of their race, religion, nationality, political opinion or because of sexual orientation.</li>
<li>Their lives would be in danger because of war or serious disruption of public order.</li>
<li>With more than 800 000 cases South Africa has more than a third of the world’s pending refugee applications. 
    Most come from Zimbabwe, Democratic Republic of Congo, Bangladesh, Pakistan and India. 
    In 2014 and the first half of 2015 the Department of Home Affairs turned down 81% of refugee applications,
    compared with the international average of 21% - by the end of the first quarter in 2015,
    2406 people had been granted asylum and for the rest of the year only 93 applications were accepted.
    Critics say that the rejection rate is so high because it is used as a ‘migration management method’ to keep people 
    out of the country and that all refugees are seen as economic migrants – the Department of Home Affairs denies that there is 
    such an objective.</li>
