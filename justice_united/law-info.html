        Civil rights are an essential component of democracy. 
        They’re guarantees of equal social opportunities and protection under the law, 
        regardless of race, religion, or other characteristics. Examples are the rights to vote, 
        to a fair trial, to government services, and to a public education. In contrast to civil liberties, 
        which are freedoms secured by placing restraints on government, civil rights are secured by positive government action, 
        often in the form of legislation.

        Unlike human rights or natural rights, in which people acquire rights inherently—perhaps 
        from nature—civil rights must be given and guaranteed by the power of the state. Therefore, 
        they vary greatly over time, culture, and form of government and tend to follow societal trends 
        that condone or abhor types of discrimination. For example, the civil rights of the LGBTQ community 
        have only recently come to the forefront of political debate in some democracies.

        When the enforcement of civil rights is found by many to be inadequate, 
        a civil rights movement may emerge in order to call for equal application 
        of the laws without discrimination.

        The marginalization of African Americans spurred the American civil rights movement, 
        beginning in the 1950s and growing throughout the early 1960s. 
        That movement, based mainly in African American churches and colleges of the South, 
        involved marches, boycotts, and civil disobedience, such as sit-ins. Most efforts were local, 
        but the impact was felt at the national level—a model of civil rights organizing that has since spread all over the globe.

            <section class="subHeading-info">
                The Constitution lays the foundation for our democracy in South Africa, which has recently celebrated
                its 20th year. The Constitution which was passed into law by Parliament, binds the State to “Heal
                the divisions of the past and establish a society based on democratic values, social justice and
                fundamental human rights,” (Preamble, Constitution).
                <br/>
                Parliament has also passed laws that promote a culture of respect for human rights, and has
                repealed those laws which have undermined this. The Promotion of Equality and Prevention of
                Unfair Discrimination Act (PEPUDA) of 2000 is one such piece of legislation. This law aims to promote
                equality (as per Section 9 of the Bill of Rights), and importantly, it ensures that Magistrates Courts
                become Equality Courts where cases of unfair discrimination can be tried.

                South Africa is a signatory to a number of conventions which seek to protect the human rights
                of everyone globally and locally especially those who are most vulnerable including women and
                children. Firstly, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is a predecessor to our Bill of Rights.
                Secondly, South Africa signed the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against
                Women (CEDAW); the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the International Convention on
                the Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD).
